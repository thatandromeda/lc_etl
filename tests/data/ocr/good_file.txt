According to announcement, this school was opened for a six weeks' session Friday, June 21, for the enrollment of pupils only, a corps of eight public school teachers having been selected to take charge of the various grades (Kindergarten-8th).

Nearly 800 children, some of whom had come from various points in the suburbs, and from schools as far distant as the Randall, Logan, etc., etc., applied for admission, but of course all could not be entered because of the small number of teachers. The regretful looks and the tearful appeals of those turned away, and the foregoing facts indicated that the vacation school was not a "new broom", but an instant success, and was a sufficient answer to any inquiry as to whether there was any real demand on the part of the public for such a school. It is highly creditable to the people of Washington that they show such readiness to embrace every opportunity for the education of their children.
